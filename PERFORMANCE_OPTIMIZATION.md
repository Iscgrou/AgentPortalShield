# Performance Optimization - MarFaNet System

## Overview
Comprehensive performance optimization for the MarFaNet financial management system, focusing on database queries, API response times, and overall system efficiency.

## Current Performance Metrics
- Average API response time: 25-250ms (from logs)
- Database query performance: Good (sub-100ms for most queries)
- Frontend load time: Fast HMR updates observed
- Memory usage: Stable (no memory leaks detected)

## Optimization Areas

### 1. Database Performance
**Current Status:** Good base performance
**Optimizations Implemented:**
- Connection pooling with Drizzle ORM ✅
- Indexed queries on primary keys ✅
- Efficient WHERE clauses ✅

**Additional Optimizations:**
- Add composite indexes for frequent query patterns
- Implement query result caching for static data
- Optimize JOIN operations in complex queries

### 2. API Performance
**Current Status:** 25-250ms response times
**Target:** <100ms for critical operations

**Optimizations:**
- Response compression
- Request/Response caching
- Database query optimization
- Async operation optimization

### 3. Frontend Performance
**Current Status:** Fast development HMR
**Optimizations:**
- Code splitting for large components
- Lazy loading for non-critical pages
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Image optimization

### 4. Memory Management
**Current Status:** Stable
**Optimizations:**
- Connection pool optimization
- Garbage collection monitoring
- Memory leak prevention

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority:** Database query optimization
2. **Medium Priority:** API response caching  
3. **Low Priority:** Frontend bundle optimization
