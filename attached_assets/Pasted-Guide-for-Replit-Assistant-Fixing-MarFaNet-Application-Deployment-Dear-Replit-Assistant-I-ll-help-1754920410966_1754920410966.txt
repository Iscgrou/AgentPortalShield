Guide for Replit Assistant: Fixing MarFaNet Application Deployment
Dear Replit Assistant,

I'll help troubleshoot the issues with the MarFaNet application deployment. The "npm: command not found" error indicates a fundamental Node.js environment problem that needs to be addressed before proceeding with the application setup.

Step 1: Fix Node.js Environment

# Check if Node.js is installed
which node
which npm

# If not installed, configure the Replit to use Node.js
# In Replit, this is typically done by:
# 1. Clicking on the "Shell" tab
# 2. Running these commands:
npm init -y
# OR if that fails, try:
nix-env -i nodejs
# OR use the Replit package manager
replit-pm install nodejs@20


Step 2: Configure .replit File

# Create or update the .replit file
echo 'run = "npm start"
entrypoint = "server/index.ts"
hidden = [".config", "package-lock.json"]

[nix]
channel = "stable-22_11"

[env]
NODE_ENV = "development"
PORT = "5000"

[packager]
language = "nodejs"
  [packager.features]
  packageSearch = true
  guessImports = true
  enabledForHosting = false

[languages.javascript]
pattern = "**/{*.js,*.jsx,*.ts,*.tsx}"
  [languages.javascript.languageServer]
  start = ["typescript-language-server", "--stdio"]' > .replit


Step 3: Setup Environment Variables

# Create a proper .env file based on the example
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file with proper credentials, especially the DATABASE_URL


Step 4: Package Installation and Database Migration

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migration (preserving data)
npm run db:push

Step 5: Fix Port Configuration for Replit

# Update port configuration in server code to work with Replit
# Replit typically exposes apps on its own port
# Add this to your server initialization:
sed -i 's/const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000/const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000/' server/index.ts


Common Issues to Check:
Node Version Mismatch: Replit may use a different Node.js version than expected. Add an .nvmrc file with v20.19.3 content.

Database Connection: Verify Neon PostgreSQL connection is accessible from Replit's network.

Package.json Scripts: Ensure start script exists:

"scripts": {
  "start": "NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "db:push": "drizzle-kit push:pg"
}


Replit-Specific Configuration:

Check if a replit.nix file exists and contains proper Node.js configuration
Ensure Replit's "Secrets" tool has your environment variables configured
Please let me know if you need specific details about Replit's configuration system to better adapt these instructions.
